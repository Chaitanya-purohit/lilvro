"""
speech_styler.py — Post-process TTS text for a more human, natural voice.

Two independent feature flags at the top of this file:

    NATURAL_PAUSES   — adds strategic commas/ellipses so Deepgram breathes
                        naturally at clause boundaries and before questions.

    UX_WARMTH        — varies sentence openers, softens corrections, adds
                        light encouragement without touching the math content.

Usage:
    from speech_styler import style_speech
    speakable = style_speech(render_math(llm_reply))

To disable either feature, set the flag to False below.
